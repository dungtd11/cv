Dear HR Department,

My name is Nguyễn Văn Hải, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fresher Java Developer position at your esteemed company.

I have recently graduated with a degree in Information Technology and have completed a 6-month internship at Bachkhoa-Aptech, where I worked on a full backend knowledge-sharing website using Spring Boot. Over the past 3 years, I have continuously deepened my expertise in the Spring Boot framework, and have independently built several practical projects utilizing Microservice Architecture, RESTful APIs, and modern development tools.

After learning about this opportunity via [source of the job post] and discussions within the developer community on Facebook, I am truly excited about the chance to contribute to your projects and grow within a dynamic and professional environment.

Please find attached my CV for your reference. I would be very grateful for the opportunity to further discuss how I can be a valuable addition to your team in a personal interview.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Nguyễn Văn Hải
